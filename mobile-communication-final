## 🎥 Multimedia Requirements

| Type  | Delay | Packet Loss | Bit Error Rate | Data Rate  | Traffic  |
|-------|-------|--------------|----------------|------------|----------|
| Voice | <100 ms | <1%         | 10⁻³           | 8–32 Kbps  | Continuous |
| Video | <100 ms | <1%         | 10⁻⁶           | 1–100 Mbps | Bursty   |
| Data  | -       | <1%         | 10⁻⁶           | 1–20 Mbps  | Continuous |

A single network design cannot handle all types efficiently; customization is needed.
