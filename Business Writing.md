# Plagiarism
**Plagiarism** is when someone copies someone else's work or ideas and pretends it’s their own, without giving credit to the original creator.

### Key Forms of Plagiarism:

1. **Direct Plagiarism**  
   - Copying someone else’s work or ideas word-for-word without giving credit.  
   *Example:* Copying text from an article and using it in your paper as if you wrote it.

2. **Paraphrasing Plagiarism**  
   - Rewriting someone else’s work in your own words but not giving them credit.  
   *Example:* Changing the wording of a paragraph from a book and using it without citing the source.

3. **Self-Plagiarism**  
   - Reusing your own previously written work or ideas in a new project without permission or proper acknowledgment.  
   *Example:* Submitting the same essay for two different assignments without informing the instructor.

### How to Avoid Plagiarism:

1. **Proper Citation**  
   - Always credit the original author or source when you use their work. Use the correct citation style (e.g., APA, MLA, Chicago).  

2. **Paraphrasing Correctly**  
   - Restate the original ideas in your own unique words and sentence structure while still giving credit to the source.  

3. **Quoting**  
   - If you use the exact words from a source, place them in quotation marks and cite the source properly.  

4. **Using Citation Tools**  
   - Use tools like Zotero, EndNote, or online citation generators to create accurate citations and bibliographies.  

5. **Originality**  
   - Focus on expressing your own ideas, thoughts, and analysis rather than relying heavily on external sources. Use sources to support your points, not replace them.  

By following these steps, you can ensure your work remains ethical and free from plagiarism.

### Citation:  
A **citation** is a way of telling readers where you got your information. It gives credit to the original author and helps others find the source.  
*Example:* (Smith, 2023)  

### Bibliography:  
A **bibliography** is a list of all the books, articles, and other sources you used to create your work. It usually appears at the end of your document.  
*Example:*  
Smith, J. (2023). *Introduction to Writing*. New York: Writing Press.  

### Use of Footnotes:

1. **Citation**  
   - Footnotes are often used to cite sources or references for specific information in the text. They provide detailed information about the source without disrupting the flow of the main content.  
   *Example:*  
   "The earth revolves around the sun."¹  
   ¹ Copernicus, N. (1543). *On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres*.  

2. **Explanation**  
   - They can include additional details or explanations that support the main text but are not essential for immediate understanding.  
   *Example:*  
   "This method is widely used in physics experiments."²  
   ² This refers to experiments involving quantum mechanics and particle physics.  

3. **Supplementary Information**  
   - Footnotes can provide extra information, such as definitions, background details, or commentary, which may enhance the reader’s understanding without overcrowding the main text.  
   *Example:*  
   "The term 'Renaissance' is often associated with cultural rebirth."³  
   ³ The Renaissance period spanned from the 14th to the 17th century, originating in Italy.  

Footnotes are valuable for keeping the main content concise while still offering important references or details.

### Formatting:  
**Formatting** refers to organizing and presenting text and documents in a clear, consistent, and professional way. It includes setting margins, fonts, spacing, headings, and citations based on specific guidelines or styles.
