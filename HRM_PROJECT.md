## Lecture 2: Environment of HRM

### Introduction to Business Environment

The business environment encompasses all external and internal factors that directly or indirectly influence business operations, including decisions, strategies, processes, and performance. These environmental factors are typically beyond the direct control of the business organization, making it crucial for managers to understand and adapt to these conditions.

The relationship between business organizations and their environment is best understood through the **systems concept**, which views a business enterprise as a system comprising various interconnected sub-systems. Each sub-system has its own set of processes - for example, the production sub-system includes supply chain management, inventory control, and quality assurance, while the marketing sub-system encompasses product development, pricing, sales promotion, and distribution channels.

### Systems Concept and Synergy

The systems theory has revolutionized management perspectives by encouraging managers to look beyond their individual functional areas and consider the organization as a whole. A critical element of this concept is **synergy** - the principle that the whole organization is greater than the sum of its individual parts. This means that when different departments and functions work together effectively, they create value that exceeds what each could achieve independently.

### Categories of Business Environment

The business environment is broadly categorized into two main types:

**1. Internal Environment**
This includes all factors within the organization's direct control, such as organizational structure, culture, resources, and internal processes.

**2. External Environment**
This consists of factors outside the organization's direct control and is further divided into:

- **Micro Environment**: The immediate external environment including customers, suppliers, competitors, lenders, creditors, and direct intermediaries
- **Macro Environment**: The broader external environment encompassing economic, political, legal, social, cultural, and technological factors

### External Environmental Factors

#### Economic Environment

The economic environment significantly impacts HRM practices and consists of three main components:

**Economic Structures**
These refer to the economic conditions of a nation, including:
- Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
- Per capita income
- Market conditions for goods and services
- Capital availability
- Foreign exchange reserves
- International trade growth

Economic structures define the level of economic advancement and describe the balance between primary (agriculture, mining), secondary (manufacturing), tertiary (services), and quaternary (knowledge-based) sectors.

**Economic Systems**
Economic systems determine how societies allocate limited resources:
- **Capitalist Economy**: Market-driven resource allocation

## Lecture 3: Workflow Analysis and Strategic Job Analysis

### Future of Work and Talent Management

The systematic approach to talent management involves five key processes:

1. **Workforce and Job Analysis**: Determining required tasks and responsible personnel
2. **Human Resource Planning**: Forecasting manpower requirements
3. **Recruitment**: Attracting qualified applicants
4. **Selection**: Identifying best-fit candidates
5. **Placement**: Final candidate selection and job offers

### Workflow Analysis

Workflow analysis is a comprehensive study of how work moves through an organization, examining inputs, activities, and outputs. It involves defining work processes and dividing them into specific jobs.

**Key Definitions:**
- **Work**: Effort directed toward producing results
- **Job**: A grouping of tasks, duties, and responsibilities constituting an employee's total work

**Workflow Interdependency:**
Modern organizations feature complex workflow interdependencies where different departments must collaborate. For example, marketing and finance teams working together on advertising budgets, or customer service representatives coordinating with technical teams for service delivery.

**Steps in Workflow Analysis:**
1. Understanding business goals and strategies
2. Identifying inputs, processes, and outputs
3. Identifying unit-wise tasks
4. Documenting required time, resources, and effort
5. Preparing final workflow documentation

### Job Design and Redesign

Job design involves organizing tasks, duties, and responsibilities into productive work units. The **Job Characteristics Model** developed by Hackman and Oldham identifies five key job characteristics:

1. **Skill Variety**: Range of skills required for task completion
2. **Task Identity**: Degree of completing whole work pieces
3. **Task Significance**: Impact on other people's lives
4. **Autonomy**: Decision-making freedom in work execution
5. **Feedback**: Clear performance information availability

**Job Redesign Strategies:**
- **Job Enlargement**: Adding activities at the same level
- **Job Enrichment**: Increasing responsibility, achievement, and growth opportunities
- **Job Rotation**: Systematic movement between different jobs

### Job Analysis

Job analysis is the primary tool for collecting job-related data, essential for filling any job vacancy effectively. It ensures placing the right person in the right position at the right time.

**Three Components of Job Analysis:**

**1. Job Content**
Information about job activities including:
- Duties and responsibilities
- Specific tasks and activities
- Required tools and equipment
- Expected output levels
- Training requirements

**2. Job Context**
Working conditions and situational factors:
- Physical working environment
- Reporting relationships
- Supervisory responsibilities
- Physical and mental demands
- Associated risks and hazards

**3. Job Requirements**
Essential qualifications for job eligibility:
- Educational qualifications
- Required skills and knowledge
- Necessary abilities and aptitudes
- Experience requirements
- Personality attributes

### Job Analysis Outcomes

**Job Description**
An organized statement of duties and responsibilities including:
- Job title and organizational location
- Supervision given and received
- Specific duties and tasks
- Required materials and equipment
- Superior and subordinate relationships
- Compensation details
- Working conditions
- Training opportunities

**Job Specification**
A statement of minimum employee qualifications including:
- Educational requirements
- Required knowledge base
- Personal abilities and aptitudes
- Specific skills needed
- Personal characteristics
- Prior experience requirements

### Conducting Job Analysis

**Step-by-Step Process:**
1. **Determine Purpose**: Understand why job analysis is needed
2. **Select Positions**: Choose relevant positions for analysis
3. **Review Secondary Information**: Gather background data
4. **Analyze the Job**: Identify responsibilities and segregate duties
5. **Develop Documentation**: Create comprehensive job descriptions and specifications

### Strategic Job Analysis

Traditional job analysis faces criticism in rapidly changing environments:

**Limitations of Traditional Approach:**
- Job descriptions become outdated quickly
- Emphasis on specialization may be anachronistic
- Strict job descriptions limit creative thinking
- Focus on individual jobs rather than interdependence
- Lack of growth progression clarity
- Often conducted by HR staff with limited technical knowledge

**Strategic Shifts:**
1. Narrow functional roles to generalist orientation
2. Specialization to multi-skilling
3. Job descriptions to job fluidity
4. Jobs to profiles
5. Tasks to roles
6. Skills to attitudes
7. IQ to emotional intelligence
8. Technical to conceptual and human skills
9. Duties to personal contributions
10. Present focus to future opportunities

### Dejobbing Concept

Dejobbing reflects the need for organizational responsiveness in rapidly changing environments. Workers are paid for performance rather than fixed hours, with varying levels of implementation based on organizational growth stages.

**Supporting Factors:**
- Rapid technological change
- Demographic shifts
- Flatter organizational structures
- Networked and boundaryless organizations

**Industry Applications:**
- High-tech industries commonly use cross-functional project teams
- Different approaches needed for operational vs. high-tech roles
- Traditional job analysis remains relevant for routine, task-based positions

**Dejobbing Characteristics:**
- Combining specialized jobs into enlarged, enriched roles
- Collective responsibility for results
- Reduced supervisory oversight
- Increased employee decision-making authority
- Small team empowerment

### Competency Profiling

Competency profiles list required competencies, traits, knowledge, and experience for multi-skilled job contexts, including:

**Required Elements:**
- **Competencies**: Know-how, behaviors, and abilities
- **Personal Attributes**: Traits and personality characteristics
- **Knowledge**: Technical and professional expertise
- **Experience**: Educational and work achievements

### Strategic Job Modeling (SJM)

SJM develops trajectories of work competencies expected from job incumbents, considering both present and future requirements:

**Competency Types:**
- **Can-do Competencies**: Present skills and abilities
- **Will-do Competencies**: Future skills and potential

**Example: British Petroleum**
BP replaced traditional job descriptions with skills matrices for each job family, creating more efficient and responsive organizational structures.
