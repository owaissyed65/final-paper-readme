# Pakistan Studies Notes

Great. I’ll prepare a concise summary of Pakistan’s river systems, covering all major river systems and key aspects such as geography, hydrology, ecology, and economic importance.
I’ll update you shortly with the summary.


# River Systems of Pakistan

**Indus River System:** Pakistan’s waterways are dominated by the Indus Basin. The **Indus River** originates on the Tibetan Plateau (Lake Mansarovar) and flows \~3,200 km south through Gilgit-Baltistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab into the Arabian Sea (Sindh). Its major tributaries form the historic “Land of Five Rivers”: the *Jhelum*, *Chenab*, *Ravi*, *Sutlej*, and *Beas*.  (The Beas joins the Sutlej in India before entry into Pakistan.)  The Jhelum rises in Indian Kashmir and meets the Chenab near the Punjab plains; the Chenab comes down from the Indian Himalayas; the Ravi and Sutlej originate in Himachal Pradesh and enter Punjab (though their waters are largely allocated to India under the Indus Waters Treaty). The **Kabul River** (from Afghanistan) joins the Indus near Attock.  Major dams on this system include Tarbela (Indus River, 4,888 MW, 11 million acre-ft reservoir) and Mangla (Jhelum River, 1,000 MW, 7.4 million acre-ft), which regulate flood peaks and store summer melt. These projects (part of the Indus Basin Project) buffer the monsoon floods (July–Sept) and augment low winter flows. (The **Kabul River** itself is dammed at Warsak for hydroelectricity and irrigation; it flows 435 mi from Afghanistan through Peshawar into the Indus.)

**Other Major Rivers:**  Beyond the Indus system, Pakistan has several important rivers:

* **Kabul River (700 km):** Rises in Afghan highlands, flows east past Jalalabad and Peshawar, then enters Pakistan (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) and joins the Indus just north of Islamabad. It is extensively used for irrigation (many stretches dry in summer) and has the Warsak Dam (built 1960s) for power/drinking water.
* **Gomal River:** Originates in Afghanistan and flows through South Waziristan (KPK), joining the Indus near Dera Ismail Khan. (The Gomal Zam Dam provides irrigation in the Gomal valley.)
* **Other Indus tributaries:**  *Swat* (flows into Indus at Charsadda, KPK; reservoir: Munda Dam), *Neelum* (flows into Jhelum at Muzaffarabad; dam: Neelum–Jhelum) and *Kunhar* in Kaghan/Swat. In south Punjab/Sindh the Indus receives smaller hill streams, but surface flow additions in the plains are minor (many small canals and nullahs exist).
* **Balochistan Rivers:**  Major streams like the *Hingol* (Balochistan’s longest, \~350 km) flow across the Makran coast and form an estuary before reaching the Arabian Sea. The Hingol River flows year-round and its estuary supports threatened fish, birds and even crocodiles; it lies at the heart of Hingol National Park. Other Balochistan rivers include the *Hub* (forms Sindh–Balochistan border, dammed at Hub for Karachi’s water supply), *Zhob* (flows east to join the Gomal), *Porali*, *Nari* and *Dasht* (draining the Makran). Many of these are seasonal or intermittent.
* **Sindh and Karachi Streams:**  In Sindh, apart from the Indus, small rivers like the *Shri Jagir*, *Kechnūl* (freshwater desert springs) exist. In Karachi the *Lyari* and *Malir* are ephemeral streams draining into the Arabian Sea.

## Hydrology and Dams

Pakistan’s rivers are fed by Himalayan/Karakoram snowmelt and the South Asian monsoon.  Flows are highly seasonal: winter (Dec–Feb) discharge is minimal, then snow/glacial melt raises levels in spring, and monsoon rains (Jul–Sept) produce annual flood peaks.  For example, the Upper Indus (north of Tarbela) carries about 110 km³/year (half of the system’s total); Jhelum+Chenab contribute \~25% and Ravi/Beas/Sutlej the remainder.  Overall Indus flows are on the order of 180–220 km³ per year.

Major hydraulic infrastructure controls these flows. Besides Tarbela and Mangla (above), other key dams include **Chashma (Indus)** for irrigation/power, **Warsak (Kabul)**, and **Hub Dam (Hub River)** for Karachi’s supply. The under-construction **Diamer-Bhasha Dam** on the Indus (in Gilgit–Baltistan) will add \~14.3 km³ storage and \~4,500 MW capacity; **Dasu Dam** (Indus) and **Kurram Tangi/Gomal Zam** (Kabul/Gomal tributaries) also boost hydropower.  Collectively these reservoirs store monsoon water to release in dry months.  River gauge data show that about 60–70% of Pakistan’s flow occurs in July–September.  According to Pakistan’s water authorities, the western tributaries (Indus, Jhelum, Chenab) supply roughly 104 million acre-feet (MAF) for agriculture, with \~35 MAF actually reaching the sea each year.  (Seasonal flooding can severely impact Sindh—e.g. the devastating 2010 and 2011 floods were largely the result of exceptional monsoon runoff along the Indus and its tributaries.)

## Ecology and Biodiversity

Pakistan’s rivers and floodplains support rich biodiversity, especially in wetlands and mountainous headwaters. The **Indus Delta** (Sindh) – where the river fans into the Arabian Sea – spans \~41,000 km² (with \~6,000 km² active Delta). It contains the world’s largest arid mangrove forest and a network of creeks and estuaries. This delta and associated wetlands are critical habitat for many migratory birds, fish and estuarine species. For example, the delta harbors giant snakehead and various Indus-endemic fish, as well as the **Indus river dolphin** (Platanista minor) – one of the world’s rarest cetaceans.  Only about 1,000–1,800 Indus dolphins remain, confined to fragmented pools in the lower river. Damming and irrigation canals have isolated these populations.

The rivers also host endangered freshwater fauna.  The *golden mahseer* (Tor putitora) – a prized game fish – is endangered in the rivers; the Kashmir catfish (Glyptothorax kashmirensis) is found only in the Jhelum and is critically endangered. The *gharial* (Gavialis gangeticus), once present in the Indus, is now almost extirpated; the narrow-headed softshell turtle (Chitra indica) is endangered in Pakistan.

In upland areas and Balochistan, rivers support key wildlife. Hingol National Park’s riparian zones, for example, sustain Sindh ibex, Balochistan urial and chinkara antelope. The Hingol River (longest in Balochistan) flows year-round through the park and empties into an estuary rich in fish and birds. Overall, Pakistan has identified over 225 **wetland sites** (from Karachi coast to high Himalayas) important for waterfowl and biodiversity.  As one conservation report notes, “Streams and rivers are not only the lifeline of agriculture and hydropower, but also provide livelihoods… through artisan fisheries, and \[serve] as a refuge for large numbers of wintering migratory birds”.

## Economic Importance

Pakistan’s economy depends on its rivers.  The Indus Basin Irrigation System is among the **world’s largest contiguous canal networks**, covering roughly 150,000 km² of cropland.  Over **90%** of Pakistan’s freshwater is withdrawn for irrigation. This water supports the cotton, wheat, rice and sugarcane fields of Punjab and Sindh.  For example, canals from Tarbela and Mangla feed the upper and lower Indus plains, enabling the fertile Punjab-Potwar “breadbasket.”  (Pakistan’s cold-climate wheat and hot-season rice depend on this irrigation.) Rivers also supply most municipal water: Karachi receives drinking water from Hub and Indus canals, Lahore from Ravi/Jhelum-fed canals, Islamabad from river reservoirs, etc.

Hydropower is another major benefit. Tarbela (4,888 MW) and Mangla (1,000 MW) together meet a significant portion of Pakistan’s electricity needs. The Warsak Dam supplies Peshawar’s grid, and smaller projects (Neelum–Jhelum, Satpara in Skardu) add renewable power. The ongoing Diamer-Bhasha and Dasu projects will more than double Pakistan’s hydro capacity.  Rivers also support fisheries: although largely artisanal, riverine fishing is an important livelihood for many rural communities.

In summary, Pakistan’s rivers – led by the Indus system – shape the nation’s geography and life. Originating in the Himalayas and Hindu Kush, they carve through mountains and deserts, sustaining diverse ecosystems. Through a vast network of dams and canals, their waters irrigate crops, generate power, and supply cities. Protecting these river systems’ health (water quantity and quality, wetlands and species) is vital for Pakistan’s food security, economy and environment.
