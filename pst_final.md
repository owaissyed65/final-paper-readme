Here’s a structured, detailed summary of Pakistan’s river systems, organized heading‑wise for clarity:

---

## 1. **Indus River System** 🌊

### Geography & Course

* **Origin**: Tibetan Plateau near Lake Manasarovar (Mansarovar Glacier) in Kailash range
* **Length & Path**: \~3,200 km; flows NW into Ladakh, then SSW through Pakistan—Gilgit–Baltistan → Khyber Pakhtunkhwa → Punjab → Sindh → Arabian Sea ([pc.gov.pk][1], [nextias.com][2])

### Hydrology & Flow

* **Snow‑fed & Monsoon‑dependent**: Minimal in Dec–Feb, rising Mar–Jun, peaking Jul–Aug, tapering by Oct ([britannica.com][3])
* **Annual discharge**: Upper Indus \~110 km³ (\~26.5 mi³); Jhelum + Chenab \~25%; Ravi, Beas, Sutlej remainder ([britannica.com][3])

### Tributaries

#### Left‑bank (Eastern):

* **Chenab**, **Jhelum**, **Ravi**, **Sutlej**, **Beas** – originate in Indian Himalayas; join at Panjnad before entering Pakistan ([nextias.com][2])

#### Right‑bank (Western):

* **Shyok**, **Nubra**, **Kabul**, **Swat**, **Gomal**, **Tochi**, **Kurram** – mostly originate in Himalayas/Karakoram/Hindu Kush ([nextias.com][2])

  * *Kabul River* merges near Attock (also dammed by Warsak Dam)

### Dams & Reservoirs

* **Tarbela** (Indus): 4,888 MW, 11 MAF
* **Mangla** (Jhelum): 1,000 MW, 7.4 MAF
* **Chashma**, **Warsak**, **Diamer‑Bhasha** (under construction), **Dasu** – all regulate flow for irrigation and power

### Ecology & Biodiversity

* **Delta wetlands**: 41,000 km² with \~6,000 km² active, including the world’s largest arid mangrove forest ([reuters.com][4])
* **Key species**: Indus dolphin (\~1,000–1,800), golden mahseer, Kashmir catfish, gharial—many endangered ([ebsco.com][5])

### Economy & Irrigation

* Backbone of Pakistan’s agriculture—\~90% of water used for irrigation; supports staples like wheat, rice, cotton ([iwaponline.com][6])
* Supports one of the world’s largest canal networks; major barrages include Guddu and Sukkur ([en.wikipedia.org][7])
* Hydropower from main dams supports national electricity

---

## 2. **Kabul & Other Northwestern Tributaries**

### Kabul River

* **Source**: Hindu Kush, Afghanistan → enters Pakistan at Khyber Pakhtunkhwa → merges at Attock
* **Hydropower & Irrigation**: Warsak Dam; serves Peshawar region ([nextias.com][2])

### Other tributaries

* **Gomal**, **Swat**, **Neelum (Kashmir)**, **Kunhar** – each with social/economic roles
* Dams include Neelum–Jhelum and Gomal Zam; support irrigation and power in NW Pakistan

---

## 3. **Southern & Balochistan Rivers**

Primarily non‑Indus, seasonal or perennial:

### Hingol River

* **Length**: \~560 km; longest in Balochistan ([en.wikipedia.org][8])
* **Course**: Originates in Awaran mountains, flows through Hingol National Park, then into Arabian Sea ([en.wikipedia.org][8])
* **Ecology**: Supports arid-riparian ecosystems, marsh crocodiles, migratory birds, dolphins, green & olive turtles ([en.wikipedia.org][9])
* **Culture**: Hosts Hinglaj Mata Mandir—significant Hindu pilgrimage site ([en.wikipedia.org][8])
* **Conservation**: Hingol Dam proposed (3.5 MW), park is \~6,100 km² and a Ramsar site ([en.wikipedia.org][10])

### Other Balochistan Rivers

* **Nari**, **Porali**, **Zhob**, **Hub** – primarily seasonal; support local irrigation and livestock ([graana.com][11])
* **Hub River** – dam provides water to Karachi

---

## 4. **Seasonality & Climate Variability**

All systems are snow‑ and monsoon‑fed, with high flood season (Jul–Aug) and low flow in winter. This strong seasonality pressures agriculture and water storage management ([reuters.com][12]). Climate change (glacial retreat, irregular monsoons) exacerbates water insecurity.

---

## 5. **Geopolitical & Legal Context**

* **Indus Waters Treaty (1960)**: Allocates eastern rivers (Ravi, Beas, Sutlej) to India; western rivers (Indus, Jhelum, Chenab) to Pakistan ([reuters.com][4], [nextias.com][2])
* **2025 Tensions**: India suspended aspects, halted data sharing, maintenance reduced Pakistan’s flows (\~90% drop), plans to divert via new canals (e.g., Ranbir canal) ([reuters.com][4])
