## 1. **What is Two Nation Theory?**

**Simple words**:  
Muslims and Hindus are not just two religions — they are two **different nations**.  
Their **religion**, **culture**, **language**, **food**, **politics**, **economy** — **everything is different**.

➔ That's why Muslims needed their **own country** (Pakistan).

---

## 2. **Religious Differences**

- **Muslims** believe in **one God** (Allah). They pray (namaz), fast (roza), give zakat (charity), and go for hajj (pilgrimage).
- **Hindus** believe in **many gods** and follow a **caste system** (some people treated high, some very low).

➔ Because their **basic religious beliefs** are different, living together was very hard.

---

## 3. **Cultural Differences**

- **Muslims** bury dead bodies; **Hindus** burn them.
- **Muslims** slaughter cows for food; **Hindus** worship cows as sacred.

- After Muslims lost the war of 1857, the British punished Muslims badly.
  - Took away their jobs.

---

---

## 7. **Hindi-Urdu Controversy (1867)**

**What happened?**
- Hindus demanded that **Hindi** be used instead of **Urdu**.
- Urdu was the **Muslim’s language**.

|:---|:---|
| **Sir Syed Ahmed Khan** | First person who explained "Muslims and Hindus are two separate nations". |
| **Allama Iqbal** | Gave **Allahabad Address** (1930) — said Muslims must have **their own country**. |
| **Quaid-e-Azam** | Fought politically. Believed that **Quran** should guide Muslim life and law. Demanded Pakistan. |

---

## **Example to Understand Easily**
Imagine:
- Two passengers (Muslims and Hindus) are trying to sail one boat.
- One wants to go **left**, the other **right**.
- **Boat will break** if they force each other!

➔ Best solution = **Give them two separate boats**.

That’s why Pakistan was created!

---
