# Networking Protocols Overview

This document provides a brief explanation of HTTP, FTP, SMTP, and DHCP, along with their purposes, features, and differences.

---

## 1. HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)
- **Purpose:** Transfers web pages, images, and resources from web servers to browsers.
- **Port:** Typically uses **port 80** (HTTP) and **port 443** (HTTPS for secure connections).
- **Key Features:**
  - Enables browsing websites.
  - Stateless protocol (doesnâ€™t remember previous requests).
  - Follows a client-server architecture.

---

## 2. FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
- **Purpose:** Facilitates file transfers between computers over a network.
- **Port:** Typically uses **port 21** for commands and **port 20** for data.
- **Key Features:**
  - Supports uploading and downloading files.
  - Allows authentication with username/password or anonymous access.
  - Not secure by default but can use FTPS or SFTP for secure transfers.

---

## 3. SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)
- **Purpose:** Used to send emails from clients to servers or between mail servers.
- **Port:** Uses **port 25** (default) or **port 587** for secure communication.
- **Key Features:**
  - Handles outgoing email.
  - Works in conjunction with POP3 or IMAP for receiving emails.
  - Supports encryption with STARTTLS or SSL/TLS.

---

## 4. DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
- **Purpose:** Automatically assigns IP addresses and network configurations to devices in a network.
- **Port:** Uses **port 67** (server) and **port 68** (client).
- **Key Features:**
  - Automates IP address assignment.
  - Prevents conflicts by ensuring unique IP addresses.
  - Configures subnet mask, gateway, and DNS details.

|--------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Purpose**        | Transfers web content      | File transfers             | Sending emails             | Assigns IP addresses         |
| **Transport Protocol** | TCP                      | TCP                        | TCP                        | UDP                          |
| **Default Port**   | 80 (HTTP) / 443 (HTTPS)   | 21                         | 25 / 587                  | 67 (server) / 68 (client)    |
| **Security**       | Supports HTTPS            | FTPS / SFTP for encryption | STARTTLS or SSL/TLS        | Typically no encryption      |
| **Example Use**    | Browsing websites          | Uploading/downloading files | Sending emails             | Connecting new devices to a network |
