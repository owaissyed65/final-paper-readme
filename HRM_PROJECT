---

### ðŸ”¹ Formative vs. Summative Evaluation

| Evaluation Type | Purpose                                                |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |

| **Summative**   | Conducted after delivery to assess impact and outcomes |

---

### ðŸ”¹ Why Evaluate Training?

* Justify investment in training.
* Improve future programs.
* Determine if learning objectives were met.
* Compare training benefits vs. costs.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Kirkpatrickâ€™s Four Levels of Evaluation

1. **Reaction** â€“ Did participants enjoy the training?

3. **Behavior** â€“ Is the learning being applied on the job?
4. **Results** â€“ Did it impact the companyâ€™s performance?

---

### ðŸ”¹ Types of Training Outcomes
