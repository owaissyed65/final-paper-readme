# 📘 Introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Natural Language Processing (NLP) helps computers understand human language. While computers are great at working with numbers and structured data, understanding text and speech (which are unstructured) is hard for them. NLP bridges this gap, making it possible for machines to read, listen, and understand us like humans.

Let’s learn about NLP in simple words in this README.

---

## ✅ Why Do We Need NLP?

Every day, tons of text and speech are generated — from books and emails to videos and voice messages. To make sense of this data, machines need NLP.

NLP helps in:
- Reading and understanding large texts.
- Figuring out what people are saying in different ways.
- Solving confusing sentences like:
  
  **Example:** “The boy radiated fire-like vibes.”  
  Is this about his personality or something magical? NLP tries to figure that out.

---

## NLP Pipeline – Step by Step

To understand language, NLP breaks it down into small steps:

### 1. 📌 Sentence Segmentation
Break a big paragraph into smaller sentences.  
**Example:**  
**Input:** *San Pedro is a town. It has 16,444 people.*  
**Output:**  
- Sentence 1: San Pedro is a town.  
- Sentence 2: It has 16,444 people.

---

### 2. 🧩 Word Tokenization
Split each sentence into words (called tokens).  
**Input:** *San Pedro is a town.*  
**Output:** [‘San’, ‘Pedro’, ‘is’, ‘a’, ‘town’]

---

### 3. 🏷️ Parts of Speech (POS) Tagging
Label each word as a noun, verb, etc.  
**Input:** *San Pedro is a town.*  
**Output:**  
- ‘San Pedro’ → Noun  
- ‘is’ → Verb  
- ‘a’ → Article  
- ‘town’ → Noun

---

### 4. 🌱 Lemmatization
Change words to their base form.  
**Input:** *There are buffaloes in the field.*  
**Output:** *buffalo* (root word)

---

### 5. 🚫 Stop Word Removal
Remove common words like "a", "the", "and" that don’t add much meaning.

---

### 6. 🔗 Dependency Parsing
Understand how words are related to each other.  
**Input:** *San Pedro is an island in Belize.*  
**Output:**  
- ‘San Pedro’ → subject  
- ‘is’ → verb  
- ‘island’ → object

Also helps find noun phrases like:  
**“second-largest town”** from “The second-largest town in Belize”.

---

### 7. 🗺️ Named Entity Recognition (NER)
Find names of people, places, organizations, etc.  
**Input:** *San Pedro is a town in Belize.*  
**Output:**  
- San Pedro → Place  
- Belize → Country

---

### 8. 🔁 Coreference Resolution
Find words that refer to the same thing.  
**Input:** *San Pedro is a town. It has 16,444 people.*  
**Output:** *"It"* refers to *San Pedro*.

---

## 🧠 Semantics vs. Pragmatics

| Concept     | Meaning                                                                 |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Semantics** | Meaning of words and sentences (without context).                     |
| **Pragmatics** | Meaning based on context and situation (how we use language daily).  |

---

## ⚙️ Techniques Used in NLP

### 1. 🧾 Rule-Based Methods
- Use hand-written rules (e.g., “If word = ‘cat’, then it's a noun”). These involve manually created rules and heuristics to process language data. For example, defining patterns in language to extract meaning.

### 2. 🤖 Machine Learning & Deep Learning
- Learn patterns from lots of text.
- Use smart models like:
  - Decision Trees
  - Support Vector Machines
  - **Deep Learning**: RNNs, Transformers (like BERT, GPT)

---

## 🚀 Applications of NLP

1. 🎤 **Speech Recognition** – Convert voice to text (e.g., Siri, Alexa).
2. 🌍 **Language Translation** – Translate text between languages (e.g., Google Translate).
3. 💬 **Chatbots** – Talk to users (e.g., customer service bots).
4. ✂️ **Text Summarization** – Make long articles shorter.
5. 😊 **Sentiment Analysis** – Understand emotions (e.g., is a review happy or angry?).
6. 🔍 **Information Retrieval** – Improve search results using meaning, not just keywords.

---

## 📚 Conclusion

Natural Language Processing is helping computers understand how we talk and write. It breaks complex language into steps and uses smart methods to analyze, learn, and respond.

NLP is all around us — from Google Search to chatbots — and it's becoming more powerful every day.

# 🧹 Text Preprocessing in NLP - Easy Guide

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is used in many apps like chatbots, translations, and sentiment analysis. But before using text in these apps, we need to **clean and prepare the text**. This process is called **text preprocessing**.

Good preprocessing helps models work better and faster. This README explains all the important steps in a simple way.

## ❓ Why Text Preprocessing is Important?

Real-world text is messy. It may contain:
- Typos
- Slang
- Short forms (like "can't")
- Irrelevant or noisy words

**Text preprocessing helps to:**
- 🧼 Clean the text
- 🚀 Improve model performance
- ⚡ Make processing faster

---

## ⚙️ Text Preprocessing Techniques

### 🔍 Regular Expressions
Used for finding patterns in text.
- Example: Find all emails or remove special characters.

### ✂️ Tokenization
Breaks the text into smaller parts:
- **Words**: "I love NLP" → ["I", "love", "NLP"]
- **Sentences**: "I love NLP. It's fun." → ["I love NLP.", "It's fun."]

### 🌱 Lemmatization and Stemming
Both reduce words to their root form.

| Stemming | Lemmatization |
|----------|---------------|
| Cuts off endings | Finds real word root |
| "playing" → "play" | "better" → "good" |

**Stemmers:** Porter, Lovins, Krovetz, etc.

### 🧠 Parts of Speech (POS) Tagging
Labels each word:
- "I eat apples" → `I/Pronoun eat/Verb apples/Noun`

---

## 🧪 Example: Step-by-Step Text Preprocessing

You can try these steps using Python in **Google Colab**, **Jupyter**, or any Python IDE.

### 1️⃣ Text Cleaning

```python
import re, string
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def clean_text(text):
    text = text.lower()
    text = re.sub(r'\d+', '', text)
    text = text.translate(str.maketrans('', '', string.punctuation))
    text = re.sub(r'\W', ' ', text)
    text = BeautifulSoup(text, "html.parser").get_text()
    return text
```

```python
corpus = [
    "I can't wait for the new season of my favorite show!",
    "The COVID-19 pandemic has affected millions of people worldwide.",
    "U.S. stocks fell on Friday after news of rising inflation.",
    "<html><body>Welcome to the website!</body></html>",
    "Python is a great programming language!!! 😃"
]

cleaned = [clean_text(doc) for doc in corpus]
print(cleaned)
```

---

### 2️⃣ Tokenization

```python
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')

tokens = [word_tokenize(doc) for doc in cleaned]
print(tokens)
```

---

### 3️⃣ Stop Words Removal

```python
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
nltk.download('stopwords')

stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
filtered = [[word for word in doc if word not in stop_words] for doc in tokens]
print(filtered)
```

---

### 4️⃣ Stemming and Lemmatization

```python
from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer, WordNetLemmatizer
nltk.download('wordnet')

stemmer = PorterStemmer()
lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()

stemmed = [[stemmer.stem(word) for word in doc] for doc in filtered]
lemmatized = [[lemmatizer.lemmatize(word) for word in doc] for doc in filtered]

print("Stemmed:", stemmed)
print("Lemmatized:", lemmatized)
```

---

## ➕ Extra Concepts

### 5️⃣ Handling Contractions

```python
import contractions

expanded = [contractions.fix(doc) for doc in cleaned]
print(expanded)
```
> Example: `"can't"` → `"cannot"`

---

### 6️⃣ Handling Emojis and Emoticons

```python
import emoji

emoji_text = [emoji.demojize(doc) for doc in cleaned]
print(emoji_text)
```

#### Emoticon vs Emoji:
| Emoticon | Emoji |
|----------|-------|
| Made with keyboard symbols like `:)` | Small icons like 😃 |
| Text-based | Image-based |

---

### 7️⃣ Spell Checking

```python
from spellchecker import SpellChecker

spell = SpellChecker()
corrected = [[spell.correction(word) for word in doc] for doc in tokens]
print(corrected)
```

> Corrects common typos like `fridge` → `Friday` (sometimes may be wrong!)

---

## ✅ Final Output
After applying all these steps, your text data is:
- Clean ✅
- Simple ✅
- Ready for NLP Models ✅
