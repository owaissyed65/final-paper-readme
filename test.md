# Fault Tolerance, GPU Architecture and Programming - Complete Topics

## Fault Tolerance

### Introduction to Fault Tolerance
• **Definition**: Ability of a system to continue functioning even in the presence of faults or failures
• **Importance**: Ensures systems remain operational and data integrity is maintained in reliable computing

### Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Execution
• **Synchronous Execution**: Tasks executed one after the other, blocking the program flow
• **Asynchronous Execution**: Tasks start and continue independently, without blocking the program flow

### Types of Faults
• **Hardware Faults**: Malfunctioning components, hardware errors, and physical damage
• **Software Faults**: Bugs, glitches, and errors in software code
• **Environmental Faults**: Power outages, electromagnetic interference, and temperature fluctuations

### Why Faults Occur
• **Component Wear and Tear**: Continuous use leads to degradation of hardware components
• **Overclocking and Heat**: Pushing hardware beyond designed limits increases failure risk
• **Environmental Factors**: Dust, humidity, and other environmental conditions impact hardware reliability

### Importance of Fault Tolerance
• **Mission-Critical Systems**: Systems that must operate flawlessly (medical devices, aerospace systems)
• **Data Integrity and Security**: Preventing data corruption and unauthorized access
• **Minimizing Downtime**: Keeping systems operational even during hardware failures

### Common Fault Tolerance Techniques
• **Redundancy**: Duplicating critical components to ensure continued operation
• **Error Detection and Correction**: Adding checksums or parity bits to data for error detection and correction
• **Checkpoints and Rollbacks**: Saving system states periodically to revert to known state in case of failure

### Replication and Load Balancing
• **Distributed Systems**: Replicating data and components across multiple nodes for fault tolerance
• **Ensuring High Availability**: Load balancing distributes workloads to maintain system performance

### Recovery Strategies
• **Automatic Recovery**: Systems automatically detect and recover from failures
• **Manual Intervention**: Human operators intervene to restore normal operation
• **Self-Healing Systems**: Systems that can diagnose and recover from faults without human intervention

### Challenges in Fault Tolerance
• **Overhead and Resource Consumption**: Fault tolerance mechanisms can consume extra resources
• **Complex System Design**: Designing fault-tolerant systems requires careful planning
• **Dynamic Environments**: Adapting to changing conditions and new types of faults is challenging

### Case Study: Google's Infrastructure
