## 📡 Introduction to Wireless Communication

- **Wireless communication** is the transfer of information without cables or wires, using **electromagnetic waves**.
- It allows devices to exchange data like voice, text, images, and videos.

---

## ✅ Advantages & Applications

### ✔️ Advantages

- **Mobility:** Stay connected on the move.
- **Convenience:** No need for wires.
- **Cost-effective:** Easy installation.
- **Flexibility:** Easy expansion.

### 🌍 Applications

- Mobile phones
- Wi-Fi routers
- Smart homes & IoT devices
- Satellite broadcasting
- Automated highways and smart spaces

---

## 🔮 Future of Wireless Networks

Emerging trends include:

- High-speed wireless internet
- Nth generation cellular networks (5G and beyond)
- Wireless Ad Hoc Networks
- Sensor Networks
- Smart homes and entertainment
- Ubiquitous connection for people and devices

---

## ⚙️ Design Challenges

Wireless networks face unique issues:

- Limited channel capacity and interference
- Changing traffic, user locations, and network conditions
- Hard constraints on energy and delay
- Diverse applications needing tailored solutions
- Need for cross-layer design (hardware, link, access, network, application)

## 🎥 Multimedia Requirements

| Type  | Delay  | Packet Loss | Bit Error Rate | Data Rate  | Traffic    |
|-------|--------|--------------|----------------|------------|------------|
| Voice | <100ms | <1%          | 10⁻³           | 8–32 Kbps  | Continuous |
| Video | <100ms | <1%          | 10⁻⁶           | 1–100 Mbps | Bursty     |
| Data  | —      | <1%          | 10⁻⁶           | 1–20 Mbps  | Continuous |

*One-size-fits-all protocols do not work well for wireless.*

## 📡 Current Wireless Systems

- **Cellular Networks:** Use cells and reuse channels to increase capacity. Smaller cells increase capacity but add complexity.
- **Wireless LANs (WLAN):** Local networks (Wi-Fi) with packet-based data, shared channels, best-effort service.
- **Satellite Systems:** Wide coverage, costly for two-way communication; mostly for broadcasting.
- **Paging Systems:** One-way messaging; overtaken by cellular networks.
- **Bluetooth:** Short-range, low-cost wireless for cable replacement.
- **Ad-Hoc Networks:** No backbone, peer-to-peer, self-configuring.

## 🗂️ Types of Wireless Networks

| Type  | Range | Description | Example |
|-------|-------|--------------|---------|
| **Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN)** | ~2 meters | Devices on/inside the body | Health sensors |
| **Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN)** | ~10 meters | Connect personal devices | Bluetooth |
| **Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)** | ~100 meters | Connect within buildings | Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11) |
| **Wireless Metropolitan Area Network (WMAN)** | ~5–20 km (up to 50 km) | City-wide access | WiMAX (IEEE 802.16) |
| **Wireless Wide Area Network (WWAN)** | Regional/global | Uses cellular networks | GSM, LTE, 5G |

---

## 🔀 Wireless Switching Technology

- **Packet Switching:** Main technique in wireless networks.
  - Uses short bursts of information.
  - Channels used only when needed.
  - Packets routed dynamically.
- **Virtual Circuits:**
  - Switched Virtual Circuits (SVCs): Created on demand.
  - Permanent Virtual Circuits (PVCs): Always available for data transfer.

## ⚡ Common Wireless Communication Problems

| Problem | Description |
|---------|--------------|
| **Increased Bit Error Rate** | Wireless media is prone to obstacles and interference. |
| **Lower Transmission Power** | Mobile devices have limited battery; must avoid interference. |
| **Scattering** | Signal hits small objects, causing signal spread. |
| **Reflection** | Large objects reflect waves, e.g., walls and buildings. |
| **Diffraction** | Waves bend around sharp edges, creating secondary waves. |
| **Multipath Propagation** | Signals arrive from different paths and times; causes interference. Solutions include antenna diversity.

## 🌐 Wireless Network Reference Model

- **Based on TCP/IP and OSI models**
  - **Application Layer:** User services like web browsing, email, file transfer.
  - **Transport Layer:** Provides reliable end-to-end communication.
  - **Network Layer:** Routing and forwarding of packets.
  - **Data Link Layer:** Controls access to the channel (MAC), error detection, flow control.
  - **Physical Layer:** Deals with transmission and modulation; sends bits over radio waves.

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways

- Wireless networks differ from wired networks mainly due to the medium (radio waves vs. cables), mobility, and design constraints.
- They require careful design to handle mobility, interference, power limits, and varied application needs.
- Future trends point toward smarter, faster, more adaptive wireless networks with better energy efficiency and seamless connectivity.
